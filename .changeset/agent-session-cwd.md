Fix: the run's base cwd (`WorkflowRunOptions.cwd` / `WorkflowManagerOptions.cwd`) now reaches every subagent ACP session. Previously the engine only passed a session cwd for worktree-isolated agents, so non-isolated agents silently ran in the HOST process's cwd — wrong whenever the embedder's process does not live at the project root. Precedence: worktree isolation > per-agent `agent({ cwd })` (new `AgentOptions.cwd`; relative resolves against the run cwd) > run cwd > `process.cwd()`. Like `mcpServers`, cwd is additive — never part of the resume identity hash. The SDK exposes it as `runDynamicWorkflow(script, { cwd })`.
