Session hand-off from one-shot runs: `run()` now surfaces the ACP session identity out-of-band via `RunOptions.onSessionOpen` (an `AgentSessionRef` — sessionId, backend routing id, cwd, and the agent-advertised `reopen` capabilities), and `keepSession: true` skips the release-time best-effort `session/close` so the agent-persisted session stays re-openable via the existing `runner.loadSession()`/`resumeSession()`. Workflow runs record one `AgentSessionRecord` per live agent() call — on `WorkflowRunResult.agentSessions` (present even with `journaling: false`), in journal entries (restored on resume replay), and on the `agentEnd` event/snapshot — and scripts can opt in per call with `agent(prompt, { keepSession: true })`. `InteractiveSession` gains the same `keepSession` option plus a `sessionRef` getter so held-open sessions can be persisted and re-opened later. Previously the one-shot path discarded the session id at release, making completed agents unrecoverable even though the protocol and agents support re-attach.
