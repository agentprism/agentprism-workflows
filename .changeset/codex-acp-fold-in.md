`@automatalabs/codex-acp` now lives in this monorepo at `packages/codex-acp` (#282) — imported from `VikashLoomba/codex-acp` with its full history as a non-squashed subtree, released through the ordinary Changesets train, with upstream containment (`agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`) enforced by the dependency gate as git ancestry against HEAD. `acp-agents` consumes it as a workspace dependency (published as an exact version); runtime behavior is unchanged.
