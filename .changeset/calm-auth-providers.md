Drive ACP auth + providers — the protocol's login story, and the last product-relevant passthrough group. `runner.authMethods()` surfaces the backend's advertised auth methods (env_var / terminal shapes) without opening a session — the discovery call a host's onboarding UI needs; `runner.authenticate({ methodId })` drives the login flow; `listProviders`/`setProvider`/`disableProvider`/`logout` manage multi-provider agents (gated on `agentCapabilities.providers` / `auth.logout` where the protocol advertises; `authenticate` has no advertisement — method-not-found surfaces legibly naming backend + method). New `WorkflowErrorCode.AUTH_REQUIRED` (non-recoverable): an expired/missing agent login on session/new or prompt now fails with the backend named and the advertised method ids in the message ("run authenticate() with one of: …") instead of a generic execution error — classification requires BOTH the ACP auth-required code (-32000) and its message shape, so unrelated server errors can't masquerade. Coverage: all five flip to "driven" (agent side now 15 driven / 1 guarded). Adapter reality: both claude-agent-acp and codex-acp implement authenticate + logout (codex advertises api-key / chat-gpt methods); neither implements providers/* yet.
