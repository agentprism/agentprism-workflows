Serve MCP-over-ACP — the client-side ACP surface is now COMPLETE (14/14 methods served). Hosts can proxy in-process MCP servers over the ACP connection: declare `{ type: "acp", name, serverId }` in `mcpServers` and provide `clientHandlers.mcp` (`connect`/`message`/`disconnect`, all-or-nothing like terminal handlers) — payloads stay opaque, so any MCP implementation plugs in. Requests route with per-session context (`connectionId`→session tracked; the client allocates `McpConnectionId`), and live MCP connections are best-effort disconnected on session release/connection death — never leaked. The ACP transport is gated strictly on BOTH sides before any tokens are spent: the agent must advertise `mcpCapabilities.acp` AND the client must have `mcp` handlers wired; a declaration either side can't serve fails fast with a distinct message. Note: neither claude-agent-acp 0.56 nor codex-acp 1.4 advertises the ACP transport yet — coverage is protocol-complete and fixture-verified; the gate protects against declaring it prematurely.
