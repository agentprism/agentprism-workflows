Integrator surface, milestone 2: interactive multi-turn sessions and human-in-the-loop permissions.

- **Interactive sessions** (`runner.openSession(options)` → `InteractiveSession`): a held-open, multi-turn ACP session backed by a **dedicated** agent process (never a pool slot — a long-lived chat loop cannot starve one-shot `run()` calls). One prompt turn at a time (`prompt(content, { images?, promptMeta? })` → `{ stopReason, text }` with per-turn text); per-session filtered event subscriptions (`session.on(...)`, auto-removed on release); `cancel()` for the in-flight turn; idempotent `release()` that closes the session and disposes the process. Process death auto-releases the session (observable via `session_close`; in-flight prompts reject), dedicated processes are covered by a process-exit kill net, `runner.dispose()` releases open sessions first, and held-open sessions don't accumulate completed-turn text/history (`retainSessionLog: false` internally).
- **Async permission resolver** (`createAcpRunner({ onPermissionRequest })`, per-session override via `openSession({ onPermissionRequest })`): parks permission requests for a human decision instead of the sync `ToolPolicy` path. Every parked request is guaranteed to settle with the ACP `cancelled` outcome on session release, turn cancel, or connection death — a parked request can never strand an agent turn. New additive `permission_pending` event fires when a request parks (the existing `permission_request` still fires exactly once with the final outcome).
- `@automatalabs/workflows` now re-exports the full documented surface: `InteractiveSession` / `InteractiveSessionOptions` / `InteractiveTurn`, `PermissionResolver`, and the milestone-1 types (`ClientHandlers`, `FsHandlers`, `TerminalHandlers`, `AcpSessionContext`, `clientCapabilitiesFor`, `NegotiatedCapabilities`, `adaptPromptContent`).
- `openSession` surfaces model routing via `onModelResolved` / `onModelFallback` like `run()`.
