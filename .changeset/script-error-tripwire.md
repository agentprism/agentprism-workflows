Script crashes are now labeled `SCRIPT_ERROR`, and a run-scoped `unhandledRejection` tripwire contains floating script promises (WE-3 embedding safety).

- New `WorkflowErrorCode.SCRIPT_ERROR`: an uncaught throw or unhandled promise rejection inside the script body. Previously a script crash surfaced as `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` (`recoverable: true`) — wrong on both counts: nobody cancelled anything, and rerunning a deterministic crash crashes again. `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` is now reserved for actual cancellation; a bare error at the manager layer falls back to `UNKNOWN`.
- Rejection tripwire: every promise the script can float is attributable to its run by REALM identity — script-created promises natively, engine-returned promises because `agent()`/`parallel()`/etc. are adopted into the script's realm at the context boundary (bonus: `agent(...) instanceof Promise` is now true inside scripts), and `.then()` chains off either. A tripped run fails with `SCRIPT_ERROR` ("Unhandled promise rejection in workflow script: …"), its in-flight agents are cancelled through a run-scoped fault signal so a zombie script stops spending tokens, and a one-macrotask drain after script completion catches trailing floats. Rejections no active realm owns preserve platform semantics: a host `unhandledRejection` listener stays in charge; with no host listener the reason is rethrown so the process fails exactly as it would have without the tripwire.
