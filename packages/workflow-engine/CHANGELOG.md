# @automatalabs/workflow-engine

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e1339e0: Add `openWorkflowDir` — a read-only, per-call-fresh view over folders of versioned
  workflow scripts, for integrators who keep their workflows in a directory instead of
  hand-rolling `readFileSync` plumbing. Construction does no I/O; every method reads the
  filesystem at call time so the view always reflects the current working tree. The
  filename stem is the workflow name (`review-pr.workflow.js` ⇒ `review-pr`; first dir
  wins across dirs, `.workflow.js` beats `.js` within one). Surface: `dirs`, `list()`
  (parsed `meta` per file), `read(name)` (throws with searched dirs + did-you-mean), and
  `resolve(name)` — the exact `loadSavedWorkflow` contract, with strict name-shape
  validation so inline nested scripts fall through and path traversal is impossible.

  `runDynamicWorkflow` gains a `workflows` option (a `WorkflowDir` view or dir path(s)):
  the first argument may then be a workflow NAME, and nested `workflow("<name>")` calls
  resolve from the same view — previously impossible through the one-shot path, which
  never wired `loadSavedWorkflow`. The validator gains the same power via
  `ValidateWorkflowOptions.workflows` and `agentprism-workflows validate <file-or-name>
--workflows-dir <dir>` (repeatable); without it, a dry-run failure caused by a nested
  bare name now carries a warning naming the fix.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 037ba2c: Backfill version bumps for the StructuredOutput tool-injection slice: shared-types gained the optional `WorkflowBackendConfig.structuredOutputTool` field and workflow-engine validates it in script `meta.backends`. Both changes shipped in the repo at v0.19.0 of the SDK but were not version-bumped; this republishes so the published types and validation match source.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b89287: Close out the remaining audit findings: dead-code removal, two small architecture seams, and a docs-truth pass with enforcement.

  - **workflow-engine**: `WorkflowManagerOptions.persistence` — inject a custom `RunPersistence` implementation (default filesystem behavior unchanged). New manager-level `journal` event (`{ runId, entry }`) streams journal entries as they append — the ingest seam for hosts that want live deltas instead of re-reading files; events are observation, so they emit even under `journaling: false` (which still writes no files and still disallows resume). Removed dead Pi-era exports: `DEFAULT_TOKEN_BUDGET`, keyword-trigger constants.
  - **acp-agents**: `AcpAgentRunner` now implements `Symbol.asyncDispose` (`await using` works); ownership rule documented (whoever constructs the runner disposes it). Removed the dead `ModelRoute.useRegex` flag.
  - **shared-types**: `ClaudeCodeSessionMeta` lost its phantom `model` member (nothing implemented it — Claude model selection rides `session/set_config_option`) and now actually types the Claude backend's session meta.
  - **workflows**: re-exports `RunPersistence` for embedders.
  - **mcp-server**: the MCP initialize response now reports the real package version instead of `0.0.0`.
  - Docs: corrected the root README's false claim that `cwd` isn't a script-level `agent()` option, the phantom Claude `_meta` model channel, stale Node 18/adapter-version references, missing elicitation events in event tables, and the acp-agents README's export list — now enforced by a docs-drift tripwire test that pins event tables and version citations to the code.

### Patch Changes

- e1c0612: Fix five audited half-wired behaviors:

  - `runDynamicWorkflow` now disposes the runner it creates internally (callers' injected runners are never disposed), eliminating a pooled-backend process leak for repeated calls in long-lived hosts.
  - `WorkflowRunOptions.instructions` is now actually prepended to every subagent's composed instructions, as documented. Unset behavior is byte-identical to before.
  - `AgentOptions.tier` now resolves through the model-tiers config (loaded once per run), with `WorkflowRunOptions.mainModel` as the documented fallback when a tier has no configured model; explicit models still win, and an unresolvable tier passes through raw so runner fallback signaling is unchanged. Journals from runs that never set `tier`/`mainModel` remain replay-compatible.
  - MCP checkpoint `confirm` now honors `kind: "select"` (enum form over `choices`), `kind: "input"` (string form), and `timeoutMs` (races elicitation and falls back to the checkpoint's headless default), instead of always eliciting a boolean.

### Minor Changes

- 8fea18f: Promote ACP session modes to a driven public surface. Runs and interactive sessions can now request strict agent-advertised modes, mode catalogs stay visible and live-updated, and unsupported or failed mode switches raise non-recoverable validation errors before prompting.

  When a mode is explicitly requested without a permission resolver, the headless permission fallback now defaults to deny so confinement is not bypassed by automatic escalation approval.

  Details: `RunOptions.mode` / `AgentOptions.mode` / `InteractiveSessionOptions.mode`, `SessionHandle.modes`/`setMode()`, `InteractiveSession.modes`/`setMode()`, `ToolPolicy.defaultOutcome`, live `current_mode_update` tracking, and `session/set_mode` flipped to "driven" in the coverage manifest. Resume compatibility: `mode` joins the journal identity hash ONLY when set, so journals written before session modes existed keep replaying for mode-less calls.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- efa034a: Per-run `cwd` on `ExecOptions` — the missing piece for worktree-per-run hosts. `startInBackground(script, args, { cwd })` / `runSync(...)` now run every subagent ACP session in that directory, overriding the manager's constructor `cwd` (which remains the key for run STATE, so `listRuns()`/`resume()` survive the run directory's deletion). The per-run cwd is persisted with the run and `resume()` re-runs in the SAME directory (e.g. the same worktree) unless explicitly overridden — confinement no longer rides on every script remembering `agent({ cwd })`. Also ships `docs/api.md`, the API reference covering the manager surface (options, ExecOptions, lifecycle, events + payload shapes), the runner surface (RunOptions, model routing, event bus, interactive sessions, capabilities), backend resolution + environment variables, and the WorkflowError code table.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- cd20994: Script crashes are now labeled `SCRIPT_ERROR`, and a run-scoped `unhandledRejection` tripwire contains floating script promises (WE-3 embedding safety).

  - New `WorkflowErrorCode.SCRIPT_ERROR`: an uncaught throw or unhandled promise rejection inside the script body. Previously a script crash surfaced as `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` (`recoverable: true`) — wrong on both counts: nobody cancelled anything, and rerunning a deterministic crash crashes again. `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` is now reserved for actual cancellation; a bare error at the manager layer falls back to `UNKNOWN`.
  - Rejection tripwire: every promise the script can float is attributable to its run by REALM identity — script-created promises natively, engine-returned promises because `agent()`/`parallel()`/etc. are adopted into the script's realm at the context boundary (bonus: `agent(...) instanceof Promise` is now true inside scripts), and `.then()` chains off either. A tripped run fails with `SCRIPT_ERROR` ("Unhandled promise rejection in workflow script: …"), its in-flight agents are cancelled through a run-scoped fault signal so a zombie script stops spending tokens, and a one-macrotask drain after script completion catches trailing floats. Rejections no active realm owns preserve platform semantics: a host `unhandledRejection` listener stays in charge; with no host listener the reason is rethrown so the process fails exactly as it would have without the tripwire.

### Patch Changes

- cd20994: Integrator hygiene: `recoverStaleRuns()` is now gated on the manager's `journaling` default — a `journaling: false` WorkflowManager (host keeps its own transcript/audit store) never rewrites persisted run state that belongs to journaling processes. All five published manifests now declare `engines.node >= 22` (previously only the private workspace root did).

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 1597c87: Fix: the run's base cwd (`WorkflowRunOptions.cwd` / `WorkflowManagerOptions.cwd`) now reaches every subagent ACP session. Previously the engine only passed a session cwd for worktree-isolated agents, so non-isolated agents silently ran in the HOST process's cwd — wrong whenever the embedder's process does not live at the project root. Precedence: worktree isolation > per-agent `agent({ cwd })` (new `AgentOptions.cwd`; relative resolves against the run cwd) > run cwd > `process.cwd()`. Like `mcpServers`, cwd is additive — never part of the resume identity hash. The SDK exposes it as `runDynamicWorkflow(script, { cwd })`.

### Patch Changes

- 1597c87: Fix: `onProgress` snapshots now carry live derived counters. The manager's mutation sites only push/patch `snapshot.agents`, so `agentCount`/`runningCount`/`doneCount`/`errorCount` stayed frozen at their initial 0s and every consumer rendered "0/0 agents" for the whole run (the MCP shell was silently working around it by re-deriving counts from `agents[]`). The manager now recomputes the counters (via `recomputeWorkflowSnapshot`) before every emission.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dab0568: Integrator surface, milestone 3: live event forwarding, embeddable persistence, and script-fault guarantees.

  - **`agentEvent` live stream** (`@automatalabs/workflows` WorkflowManager): every runner ACP event — streaming text, tool calls, permissions (including the parked `permission_pending` phase), session lifecycle — is forwarded through the manager as `agentEvent { name, event, sessionId, backendId, label?, runId? }`, so hosts can render live progress per agent. Bridged runners are reference-counted: per-exec runners unsubscribe when their run settles; the manager's own runner unsubscribes on `dispose()`.
  - **Manager events are now uniformly best-effort**: a throwing host observer on ANY manager event (`agentStart`, `log`, `agentEvent`, …) is isolated and can never fail, pause, or mask cleanup for a run.
  - **`persistenceRoot` option** (+ `AGENTPRISM_PERSISTENCE_ROOT` env; precedence option > env > home default) relocates run state + logs to a host-chosen root, resolved exactly once at manager construction. **`journaling: false`** (manager-wide or per-exec) skips journal/log/run-state writes for hosts that keep their own transcript store — resume for such runs fails with a legible "journaling disabled" error (explicit trade-off), while run leases (cross-process double-execution protection) and on-disk run listing are unaffected.
  - **Script-fault containment pinned by tests**: an uncaught throw in a workflow script — sync `Error`, thrown string, thrown object (including throwing `message` getters and circular objects), or post-`await` rejection — always surfaces as a `failed` result with a legible reason, releases the run lease, and never escapes as an unhandled rejection (direct and `startInBackground` paths).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a8c5453: Script-declared backends (`meta.backends`) — a workflow script can now declare the custom ACP backends it needs, making workflows self-contained artifacts and letting agent-authored workflows bring their own ACP servers.

  - **`meta.backends`**: `{ <name>: { command, args?, env?, sessionMeta? } }` in the script's meta block; route with `agent(p, { model: "<name>" })` or `"<name>/<inner-model>"`. The engine parses and validates the block but NEVER acts on it — script backends are inert until a composition root approves them (secure-by-default at every layer). Host-registered names always win on conflict.
  - **SDK approval**: `runDynamicWorkflow(script, { allowScriptBackends: true })` or a per-backend callback; unapproved declarations throw with guidance and a declined backend aborts the run (never a silent reroute). Lower-level callers thread pre-approved registries via `exec.scriptBackends`.
  - **MCP server approval**: clients that advertise the elicitation capability are asked to approve each unique spawn config (command/args/env shown; approvals session-sticky; an elicitation failure is a deny). Non-eliciting clients get an informative tool error naming the `AGENTPRISM_ALLOW_SCRIPT_BACKENDS=1` env opt-in.
  - **Pool correctness**: pooled connections are now keyed by spawn-config hash (`Backend.poolKey`), so two runs declaring the same backend NAME with different COMMANDS never share a process.
  - **Handshake deadline**: the one-time ACP `initialize` now has a timeout (`AGENTPRISM_ACP_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 60s) — a configured command that is not an ACP server fails fast with a legible error instead of hanging the first call.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3395bbf: Custom ACP backends + generic `_meta` passthrough — run **any** ACP agent as an `agent()` target, not just the built-in Claude/Codex pair.

  - **Backend registry**: register named ACP backends via `createAcpRunner({ backends: { name: { command, args?, env?, sessionMeta? } } })` or the `AGENTPRISM_BACKENDS` env var (JSON, same shape; the programmatic option wins per name; `claude`/`codex` reserved). Registered names route `model`/`tier` specs **before** the built-in heuristics: `model: "browser"` routes to the backend; `model: "browser/vision-large"` additionally selects `vision-large` from the agent's config-option catalog. `AGENTPRISM_DEFAULT_BACKEND` may name a registered backend. Custom backends speak the published generic dialect: a `schema` is forwarded as turn-level `_meta.outputSchema` (plain JSON Schema) and the result is JSON-parsed off the final assistant message, with the client-side validate/re-prompt ladder as the repair path.
  - **Generic `_meta` passthrough**: `RunOptions.meta` / `RunOptions.promptMeta` (script-level `agent(p, { meta, promptMeta })`) merge into the outgoing ACP `session/new` / `session/prompt` `_meta`, so workflows can drive any ACP agent's custom extension surface. Precedence: a custom backend's static `sessionMeta` defaults < per-call `meta` < backend protocol-critical keys (schema channels, Codex instruction forwards) < the engine `runId` stamp. Both fields are additive run inputs and never enter the resume identity hash — resume keys stay stable across meta changes.
