## 0.29.2

### Patch Changes

- 2561f67: Honor durable `checkpointReplies` when resuming a positional (non-`resume`-declared) run. Previously a background run paused at a durable `checkpoint(..., { headless: "pause" })` could not be continued: resuming with `resumeFromRunId` + `checkpointReplies` took the positional fallback, re-ran the whole agent prefix live, re-reached the checkpoint, and re-paused. The recorded reply is now applied after the live prefix, matched to the checkpoint's exact call path-hash so a reply only ever applies to the occurrence it targeted.

  The resume report and the MCP workflow result now surface a `checkpointReply` outcome: `applied` (with the current call index), or `not-applied` with a safe reason (`checkpoint-identity-mismatch` or `checkpoint-not-reached-at-recorded-call-site`). The not-applied report never echoes the supplied decision value.

## 0.29.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f47267: Persist terminal-shaped interruption rows for every allocated call when a run halts, and retain non-result identity blockers so completed calls remain safely replayable across usage, auth, checkpoint, and host interruptions.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 82ede81: Add the executable built-in backend registry and generated dependency manifest, expose recursively
  frozen initialize metadata on session refs and events, preserve generic ACP extension passthrough,
  and document the registry-driven onboarding and routing contract.

### Minor Changes

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- a3d5613: Treat timeout, retry, and concurrency controls as replay-neutral operational bounds; bridge
  format-1 input fingerprints and chained ancestor journals through positional replay; persist
  producing engine-version diagnostics; and expose one resume-eligibility summary across background
  admission, foreground results, await, and inspection.
- a3d5613: Recover persisted pending and running workflows whose owning process has exited into an
  interrupted, resumable pause during construction and cold lookups. Crash snapshots with a
  journaled prefix use the `crash-residue` positional bridge when the admission environment is
  stable, while environment drift keeps the run all-live.
- a3d5613: Cancel one in-flight agent by call index without aborting its workflow run, settle ignored aborts
  through an engine-owned latch, persist `AGENT_CANCELLED` visibility, and bypass retries while
  completed siblings and resume replay continue normally.
- a3d5613: Enforce run-level agent timeouts as unbypassable total-wall-clock ceilings per attempt, with
  per-call deadlines only able to tighten them and every retry receiving a fresh clock. Persist and
  report resolved timeout limits and failures, and close/recycle ACP children that ignore
  cancellation.

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [023f552]
  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.24.0

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- aac11d8: Add absolute `scriptPath` delivery, persistence-backed workflow script resources and lineage links, full resource subscription/list-change capabilities, and the `workflow` tool's durable `stop` action. Gate workflow VM execution on durable resource readback, preserve engine-owned content-free resume ancestry across run deletion, expose manager deletion observability for resource consumers, and publish exact structured-output variants.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a411c3: Add content-addressed incremental resume for manager-owned `resumeFromRunId` executions.

  - `@automatalabs/shared-types` adds the optional safety, replay-provenance, call-decision, and
    `WorkflowResumeReport` contracts; checkpoint-capable `inputsHash` documentation; and additive
    `WorkflowCallRecord` / `WorkflowRunResult` fields. Old object literals and persisted JSON remain
    readable because every new field is optional and omitted when unset.
  - `@automatalabs/workflow-engine` adds identity-v1 format admission, durable candidate seeds,
    exact path/hash plus unique content matching, filesystem/worktree barriers, checkpoint-options
    fingerprints, logical replay budget debit, current-index agent-session rebinding, and
    manager-owned `resumeFromRunId` / `resumePolicy` preparation and reports.
  - `@automatalabs/workflows` adds the DSL `agent({ resume: { filesystem: "read-only" } })` safety
    declaration, public execution options, and facade re-exports for resume reports and reason
    catalogs.
  - `@automatalabs/mcp-server` accepts optional `resumePolicy`, delegates source hydration and
    checkpoint reply mapping to the manager, returns structured resume reports with compact text
    counts, and ships regenerated identity-resume authoring guidance.

  For identity-v1-capable sources, the default policy now replays uniquely corresponding safe calls
  non-contiguously instead of stopping at the first positional miss. Cached identity hits preserve
  their source logical debit in script-visible budget gates while adding zero current provider usage,
  and replayed session records rebind to the current call index, label, and phase. New-format sources
  must pass exact cwd, Node/V8/runtime-format, terminal-environment, manifest, and seed admission;
  unsafe non-git executions without a trustworthy terminal host identity run entirely live.

  The positional escape hatch remains an index/prefix matcher, with these hardened observable rules:
  nested workflows close the parent prefix before child execution; positional cache hits emit fresh
  current-run journal/call observations; new-format positional hits require equal agent/checkpoint
  input fingerprints and proven host checkpoint decisions; and only marker-less or permanently
  legacy sources retain historical hash-only serving without the new environment facts.

  Two fail-safe compatibility changes are intentional. The common terminal gate now rejects aborted
  or `abortSignaled` marker-less/legacy sources instead of serving their cache. Terminal compaction
  also drops inherited positional suffix rows the current run never visited, so a double-hop pause
  runs that bridged tail live on the second hop rather than replaying data absent from the immediate
  source manifest. That compaction applies to every new run seeded from a prior journal — including
  low-level embedder runs supplied a manual `exec.resumeJournal` — not only manager-owned
  `resumeFromRunId` executions, keeping later hops self-contained in both entry paths.

  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.23.0

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- f93fcf3: Add typed manager event overloads and the lease-owned durable run-event stream: a new per-run
  `.events.jsonl` sidecar, mandatory write-time redaction and record bounds, listener delivery after
  durable append, nested `scope` fields, stream-generation-pinned read/watch cursors, fail-closed
  incomplete-log handling, and lease-protected deletion with no post-delete durable resurrection.

  `stop()` on a warm paused run now reacquires and revalidates the lease-protected snapshot, so it can
  return `false` when a competing process already resumed the run. Post-release execution settlement
  also no longer rewrites the snapshot, preventing stale settlement from clobbering a newer owner.

- 7b00535: Validate nondeterministic workflow APIs from executable AST call nodes so API names in prompts, descriptions, templates, and comments remain valid, and align workflow-validator guidance with the AST-aware behavior.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- 134dffc: Expose ACP session config options as a verbatim per-call authoring surface, add routed no-prompt
  catalog probing to the runner and workflow validator, and preserve existing replay hash bytes when
  the new option bag is absent or empty.

### Patch Changes

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- ef2c64b: Add call identity, per-call manifests and sealed telemetry, honest persisted run typing, budget-trajectory replay, and the backend-neutral isolation runner/report surface.

  This release also includes the complete set of observable behavior fixes made by that substrate:

  1. Throwing terminal observers are now logged and swallowed; they never retry or fail the call.
  2. Agent results and checkpoint replies must be strict-JSON snapshots; lossy values now fail with a typed error instead of being persisted in coerced form.
  3. Journal and event payloads are frozen snapshots, so listener mutation no longer reaches persistence.
  4. For strict-JSON args, persisted `args` is the pre-execution snapshot on all three run-creation paths and the VM receives an independent clone.
  5. Post-terminal events from floated calls are dropped.
  6. The VM compile filename is sanitized.
  7. Sequential nested siblings receive distinct child run IDs, observable at the runner seam and in ACP session metadata.
  8. `agentEnd` and `agentHistory` snapshot rows match by `(scope, callIndex)`, fixing duplicate-label and nested mis-attribution.
  9. Non-strict-JSON args still execute verbatim, but are marked `argsUnreplayable` and refused as isolation baselines; they are not rejected at run time.
  10. Timed-out attempts are actively aborted through a per-attempt signal.
  11. Run-ID starts acquire the lease before checking existence, closing the cross-process overwrite race.

### Minor Changes

- b256305: Add durable paused checkpoints. Workflows can opt into `headless: "pause"`, expose a non-secret `checkpointContext`, and resume with a journaled `checkpointReplies` decision that survives cold restarts.

  Expose the checkpoint context through the shared and workflows type barrels, persist and classify `CHECKPOINT_REQUIRED` runs in the engine, and add the MCP pause-and-resume wire flow for clients without elicitation.

  Re-export the persisted run and agent state types from the workflows SDK facade.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 5349c81: Add `resumeInBackground` so hosts can observe when an accepted resumed workflow actually settles.

  Keep per-execution ACP events connected for the full lifetime of resumed SDK runs, then release the bridge after settlement.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- b70293b: Error taxonomy for ACP auth: classify `AUTH_REQUIRED` code-first on `-32000` (reserved
  exclusively for `authRequired`) so localized/rephrased auth messages no longer misroute
  into the retry ladder, plus a guarded prose fallback for non-conformant agents (a different
  reserved code that merely mentions the phrase never mis-routes). Adds a structured,
  non-secret `AuthErrorContext` (`backendId` + advertised method `{id,type,name}[]`) carried on
  `WorkflowError.authContext`, and an `isAuthRequired` type guard re-exported through
  `@automatalabs/workflow-engine`. Behavior-preserving for the three first-class agents.
- fecf517: Engine pause-for-auth + cold-resume re-arm. `WorkflowManager` generalizes the
  `PROVIDER_USAGE_LIMIT` pause branch so an `AUTH_REQUIRED` fault **checkpoints the run as
  paused** (`reason: "auth_required"`) instead of failing it — the journal is preserved and
  `resume()` can finish once the host completes auth. The pause persists the structured,
  non-secret `authContext` (`backendId` + advertised method `{id,type,name}[]`) and carries it
  on the `paused` event and the composed `WorkflowRunResult`; the intent's secret payload
  (`authenticateMeta`/`envValues`) is never journaled, logged, or emitted (Principle 9).
  `resume()` re-arms cold: for an `"auth_required"` pause it consults the injected runner's
  `runner.auth.canResume(backendId)` (duck-typed — no package import) and immediately re-pauses
  with `re-supply credentials for <backend> via runner auth before resuming` when an in-process
  (gateway) / spawn-env intent was lost to a fresh process, while disk-backed intents (and warm
  same-process resume) proceed. `WorkflowRunResult.authContext` and
  `PersistedRunState.authContext` are added (both non-secret); `pauseReason` is already
  free-form so no migration. Default-off is preserved: a run that never hits `AUTH_REQUIRED`
  sees byte-identical behavior, and a runner with no `auth` controller re-pauses rather than
  re-running into the same wall.

  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.14.0

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- e97b142: Session hand-off from one-shot runs: `run()` now surfaces the ACP session identity out-of-band via `RunOptions.onSessionOpen` (an `AgentSessionRef` — sessionId, backend routing id, cwd, and the agent-advertised `reopen` capabilities), and `keepSession: true` skips the release-time best-effort `session/close` so the agent-persisted session stays re-openable via the existing `runner.loadSession()`/`resumeSession()`. Workflow runs record one `AgentSessionRecord` per live agent() call — on `WorkflowRunResult.agentSessions` (present even with `journaling: false`), in journal entries (restored on resume replay), and on the `agentEnd` event/snapshot — and scripts can opt in per call with `agent(prompt, { keepSession: true })`. `InteractiveSession` gains the same `keepSession` option plus a `sessionRef` getter so held-open sessions can be persisted and re-opened later. Previously the one-shot path discarded the session id at release, making completed agents unrecoverable even though the protocol and agents support re-attach.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e97b142]
  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.13.0

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- e1339e0: Add `openWorkflowDir` — a read-only, per-call-fresh view over folders of versioned
  workflow scripts, for integrators who keep their workflows in a directory instead of
  hand-rolling `readFileSync` plumbing. Construction does no I/O; every method reads the
  filesystem at call time so the view always reflects the current working tree. The
  filename stem is the workflow name (`review-pr.workflow.js` ⇒ `review-pr`; first dir
  wins across dirs, `.workflow.js` beats `.js` within one). Surface: `dirs`, `list()`
  (parsed `meta` per file), `read(name)` (throws with searched dirs + did-you-mean), and
  `resolve(name)` — the exact `loadSavedWorkflow` contract, with strict name-shape
  validation so inline nested scripts fall through and path traversal is impossible.

  `runDynamicWorkflow` gains a `workflows` option (a `WorkflowDir` view or dir path(s)):
  the first argument may then be a workflow NAME, and nested `workflow("<name>")` calls
  resolve from the same view — previously impossible through the one-shot path, which
  never wired `loadSavedWorkflow`. The validator gains the same power via
  `ValidateWorkflowOptions.workflows` and `agentprism-workflows validate <file-or-name>
--workflows-dir <dir>` (repeatable); without it, a dry-run failure caused by a nested
  bare name now carries a warning naming the fix.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 037ba2c: Backfill version bumps for the StructuredOutput tool-injection slice: shared-types gained the optional `WorkflowBackendConfig.structuredOutputTool` field and workflow-engine validates it in script `meta.backends`. Both changes shipped in the repo at v0.19.0 of the SDK but were not version-bumped; this republishes so the published types and validation match source.
- Updated dependencies [037ba2c]
  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.12.1

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b89287: Close out the remaining audit findings: dead-code removal, two small architecture seams, and a docs-truth pass with enforcement.

  - **workflow-engine**: `WorkflowManagerOptions.persistence` — inject a custom `RunPersistence` implementation (default filesystem behavior unchanged). New manager-level `journal` event (`{ runId, entry }`) streams journal entries as they append — the ingest seam for hosts that want live deltas instead of re-reading files; events are observation, so they emit even under `journaling: false` (which still writes no files and still disallows resume). Removed dead Pi-era exports: `DEFAULT_TOKEN_BUDGET`, keyword-trigger constants.
  - **acp-agents**: `AcpAgentRunner` now implements `Symbol.asyncDispose` (`await using` works); ownership rule documented (whoever constructs the runner disposes it). Removed the dead `ModelRoute.useRegex` flag.
  - **shared-types**: `ClaudeCodeSessionMeta` lost its phantom `model` member (nothing implemented it — Claude model selection rides `session/set_config_option`) and now actually types the Claude backend's session meta.
  - **workflows**: re-exports `RunPersistence` for embedders.
  - **mcp-server**: the MCP initialize response now reports the real package version instead of `0.0.0`.
  - Docs: corrected the root README's false claim that `cwd` isn't a script-level `agent()` option, the phantom Claude `_meta` model channel, stale Node 18/adapter-version references, missing elicitation events in event tables, and the acp-agents README's export list — now enforced by a docs-drift tripwire test that pins event tables and version citations to the code.

### Patch Changes

- e1c0612: Fix five audited half-wired behaviors:

  - `runDynamicWorkflow` now disposes the runner it creates internally (callers' injected runners are never disposed), eliminating a pooled-backend process leak for repeated calls in long-lived hosts.
  - `WorkflowRunOptions.instructions` is now actually prepended to every subagent's composed instructions, as documented. Unset behavior is byte-identical to before.
  - `AgentOptions.tier` now resolves through the model-tiers config (loaded once per run), with `WorkflowRunOptions.mainModel` as the documented fallback when a tier has no configured model; explicit models still win, and an unresolvable tier passes through raw so runner fallback signaling is unchanged. Journals from runs that never set `tier`/`mainModel` remain replay-compatible.
  - MCP checkpoint `confirm` now honors `kind: "select"` (enum form over `choices`), `kind: "input"` (string form), and `timeoutMs` (races elicitation and falls back to the checkpoint's headless default), instead of always eliciting a boolean.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8fea18f: Promote ACP session modes to a driven public surface. Runs and interactive sessions can now request strict agent-advertised modes, mode catalogs stay visible and live-updated, and unsupported or failed mode switches raise non-recoverable validation errors before prompting.

  When a mode is explicitly requested without a permission resolver, the headless permission fallback now defaults to deny so confinement is not bypassed by automatic escalation approval.

  Details: `RunOptions.mode` / `AgentOptions.mode` / `InteractiveSessionOptions.mode`, `SessionHandle.modes`/`setMode()`, `InteractiveSession.modes`/`setMode()`, `ToolPolicy.defaultOutcome`, live `current_mode_update` tracking, and `session/set_mode` flipped to "driven" in the coverage manifest. Resume compatibility: `mode` joins the journal identity hash ONLY when set, so journals written before session modes existed keep replaying for mode-less calls.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8fea18f]
  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.9.0

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- efa034a: Per-run `cwd` on `ExecOptions` — the missing piece for worktree-per-run hosts. `startInBackground(script, args, { cwd })` / `runSync(...)` now run every subagent ACP session in that directory, overriding the manager's constructor `cwd` (which remains the key for run STATE, so `listRuns()`/`resume()` survive the run directory's deletion). The per-run cwd is persisted with the run and `resume()` re-runs in the SAME directory (e.g. the same worktree) unless explicitly overridden — confinement no longer rides on every script remembering `agent({ cwd })`. Also ships `docs/api.md`, the API reference covering the manager surface (options, ExecOptions, lifecycle, events + payload shapes), the runner surface (RunOptions, model routing, event bus, interactive sessions, capabilities), backend resolution + environment variables, and the WorkflowError code table.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- cd20994: Script crashes are now labeled `SCRIPT_ERROR`, and a run-scoped `unhandledRejection` tripwire contains floating script promises (WE-3 embedding safety).

  - New `WorkflowErrorCode.SCRIPT_ERROR`: an uncaught throw or unhandled promise rejection inside the script body. Previously a script crash surfaced as `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` (`recoverable: true`) — wrong on both counts: nobody cancelled anything, and rerunning a deterministic crash crashes again. `WORKFLOW_ABORTED` is now reserved for actual cancellation; a bare error at the manager layer falls back to `UNKNOWN`.
  - Rejection tripwire: every promise the script can float is attributable to its run by REALM identity — script-created promises natively, engine-returned promises because `agent()`/`parallel()`/etc. are adopted into the script's realm at the context boundary (bonus: `agent(...) instanceof Promise` is now true inside scripts), and `.then()` chains off either. A tripped run fails with `SCRIPT_ERROR` ("Unhandled promise rejection in workflow script: …"), its in-flight agents are cancelled through a run-scoped fault signal so a zombie script stops spending tokens, and a one-macrotask drain after script completion catches trailing floats. Rejections no active realm owns preserve platform semantics: a host `unhandledRejection` listener stays in charge; with no host listener the reason is rethrown so the process fails exactly as it would have without the tripwire.

### Patch Changes

- cd20994: Integrator hygiene: `recoverStaleRuns()` is now gated on the manager's `journaling` default — a `journaling: false` WorkflowManager (host keeps its own transcript/audit store) never rewrites persisted run state that belongs to journaling processes. All five published manifests now declare `engines.node >= 22` (previously only the private workspace root did).

  - @automatalabs/shared-types@0.8.0

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 1597c87: Fix: the run's base cwd (`WorkflowRunOptions.cwd` / `WorkflowManagerOptions.cwd`) now reaches every subagent ACP session. Previously the engine only passed a session cwd for worktree-isolated agents, so non-isolated agents silently ran in the HOST process's cwd — wrong whenever the embedder's process does not live at the project root. Precedence: worktree isolation > per-agent `agent({ cwd })` (new `AgentOptions.cwd`; relative resolves against the run cwd) > run cwd > `process.cwd()`. Like `mcpServers`, cwd is additive — never part of the resume identity hash. The SDK exposes it as `runDynamicWorkflow(script, { cwd })`.

### Patch Changes

- 1597c87: Fix: `onProgress` snapshots now carry live derived counters. The manager's mutation sites only push/patch `snapshot.agents`, so `agentCount`/`runningCount`/`doneCount`/`errorCount` stayed frozen at their initial 0s and every consumer rendered "0/0 agents" for the whole run (the MCP shell was silently working around it by re-deriving counts from `agents[]`). The manager now recomputes the counters (via `recomputeWorkflowSnapshot`) before every emission.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- dab0568: Integrator surface, milestone 3: live event forwarding, embeddable persistence, and script-fault guarantees.

  - **`agentEvent` live stream** (`@automatalabs/workflows` WorkflowManager): every runner ACP event — streaming text, tool calls, permissions (including the parked `permission_pending` phase), session lifecycle — is forwarded through the manager as `agentEvent { name, event, sessionId, backendId, label?, runId? }`, so hosts can render live progress per agent. Bridged runners are reference-counted: per-exec runners unsubscribe when their run settles; the manager's own runner unsubscribes on `dispose()`.
  - **Manager events are now uniformly best-effort**: a throwing host observer on ANY manager event (`agentStart`, `log`, `agentEvent`, …) is isolated and can never fail, pause, or mask cleanup for a run.
  - **`persistenceRoot` option** (+ `AGENTPRISM_PERSISTENCE_ROOT` env; precedence option > env > home default) relocates run state + logs to a host-chosen root, resolved exactly once at manager construction. **`journaling: false`** (manager-wide or per-exec) skips journal/log/run-state writes for hosts that keep their own transcript store — resume for such runs fails with a legible "journaling disabled" error (explicit trade-off), while run leases (cross-process double-execution protection) and on-disk run listing are unaffected.
  - **Script-fault containment pinned by tests**: an uncaught throw in a workflow script — sync `Error`, thrown string, thrown object (including throwing `message` getters and circular objects), or post-`await` rejection — always surfaces as a `failed` result with a legible reason, releases the run lease, and never escapes as an unhandled rejection (direct and `startInBackground` paths).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a8c5453: Script-declared backends (`meta.backends`) — a workflow script can now declare the custom ACP backends it needs, making workflows self-contained artifacts and letting agent-authored workflows bring their own ACP servers.

  - **`meta.backends`**: `{ <name>: { command, args?, env?, sessionMeta? } }` in the script's meta block; route with `agent(p, { model: "<name>" })` or `"<name>/<inner-model>"`. The engine parses and validates the block but NEVER acts on it — script backends are inert until a composition root approves them (secure-by-default at every layer). Host-registered names always win on conflict.
  - **SDK approval**: `runDynamicWorkflow(script, { allowScriptBackends: true })` or a per-backend callback; unapproved declarations throw with guidance and a declined backend aborts the run (never a silent reroute). Lower-level callers thread pre-approved registries via `exec.scriptBackends`.
  - **MCP server approval**: clients that advertise the elicitation capability are asked to approve each unique spawn config (command/args/env shown; approvals session-sticky; an elicitation failure is a deny). Non-eliciting clients get an informative tool error naming the `AGENTPRISM_ALLOW_SCRIPT_BACKENDS=1` env opt-in.
  - **Pool correctness**: pooled connections are now keyed by spawn-config hash (`Backend.poolKey`), so two runs declaring the same backend NAME with different COMMANDS never share a process.
  - **Handshake deadline**: the one-time ACP `initialize` now has a timeout (`AGENTPRISM_ACP_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 60s) — a configured command that is not an ACP server fails fast with a legible error instead of hanging the first call.

- 3395bbf: Custom ACP backends + generic `_meta` passthrough — run **any** ACP agent as an `agent()` target, not just the built-in Claude/Codex pair.

  - **Backend registry**: register named ACP backends via `createAcpRunner({ backends: { name: { command, args?, env?, sessionMeta? } } })` or the `AGENTPRISM_BACKENDS` env var (JSON, same shape; the programmatic option wins per name; `claude`/`codex` reserved). Registered names route `model`/`tier` specs **before** the built-in heuristics: `model: "browser"` routes to the backend; `model: "browser/vision-large"` additionally selects `vision-large` from the agent's config-option catalog. `AGENTPRISM_DEFAULT_BACKEND` may name a registered backend. Custom backends speak the published generic dialect: a `schema` is forwarded as turn-level `_meta.outputSchema` (plain JSON Schema) and the result is JSON-parsed off the final assistant message, with the client-side validate/re-prompt ladder as the repair path.
  - **Generic `_meta` passthrough**: `RunOptions.meta` / `RunOptions.promptMeta` (script-level `agent(p, { meta, promptMeta })`) merge into the outgoing ACP `session/new` / `session/prompt` `_meta`, so workflows can drive any ACP agent's custom extension surface. Precedence: a custom backend's static `sessionMeta` defaults < per-call `meta` < backend protocol-critical keys (schema channels, Codex instruction forwards) < the engine `runId` stamp. Both fields are additive run inputs and never enter the resume identity hash — resume keys stay stable across meta changes.
